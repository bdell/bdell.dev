### About

I had tried to put together a personal portfolio site a few times, but I always got stuck trying to implement some wacky styling thing/by being indecisive about how I wanted things to look. After several stalled out attempts I decided to just put together a bare bones version of the site that looked terrible, but had all the content I wanted on it. Once that was all done I was finally able to go through and do a styling pass, eventually settling on a Pop Art/Comic inspired theme. Hope you enjoy!
