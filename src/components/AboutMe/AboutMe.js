                    My name is Brandon and I have been working in software development for over 8 years. I started out
                    working as a junior developer at The Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory doing statistical
                    simulations for physics research, but over the years I have transitioned to more of a front end
                    focus. During that time I have led teams of developers, worked with a plethora of frameworks, and
                    solved quite a few esoteric bugs.
